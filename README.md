# MD5 hashing (assembly implementation)

This is a toy project created for learning assembly programming language. As of now the algorithm is implemented with following limitations:

1. max message length is 2^64-1 bits
2. message length is an integer number of bytes
3. no support for stream inputs (messages of initially undetermined length)
4. code is not position-independent

Command-line interface for the utility is a work in progress.
